# Task3

## Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

Explainable AI (XAI) refers to methods and techniques in the application of artificial intelligence technology so that humans can understand the outcomes of the solution.
The Explanatory Artificial Intelligence aims to develop the machine learning and computer-human interaction tools to ensure that the end user,
who depends on decisions, recommendations, or actions produced by the artificial intelligence system, understands the reason behind the systemâ€™s decisions.
XAI will create a set of techniques for machine learning that allows human users to understand. An explainable Artificial Intelligence is one that produces details
or reasons to make its functioning clear or easy to understand.
